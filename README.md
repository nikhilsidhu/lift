# Lift

The app can be viewed at https://lift-workout-app.herokuapp.com.

Lift is a simple and easy tool for recording your lifting progress in or out of the gym. Being my first full-stack web app, this app was created as a project to practice and showcase all of the skills that I've learned thus far. I aim to learn the MERN stack and this project was a great exercise in sharpening my skills with regards to Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

## Front End

This front end of the project is coded using HTML, CSS and JavaScript I chose to code the project without the use of any front-end JavaScript framework so that I could solidify my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript before moving on to a framework. I orginally coded the CSS without a preprocessor, but after learning SCSS I decided to implement it in the project as I loved how it simplified the syntax. I used a 7-1 file structure for the SCSS files because I liked how it organized the code and made it more modular.

## Back end

The backend was coded using Node.js along with the Express framework. I chose Express because of its ease of use and popularity as it is part of the widely used MERN stack. Passport is used as middleware to implement authentication. Also part of the MERN stack, MongoDB was used as the database for this project.

## Challenges

A challenge I faced was coding the project using only vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks. I believe the addition of a framework such as React and having the ability to use components would have greatly improved the simiplicity, resuability and organization of the code.


## How to Use the App

To use the app, you must first register for an account. Once your account is created you can sign in and view your own personal workout log. You can add to your empty log by clicking on the add workout button and then filling in a title and date for your workout. To view a workout, simply click on a workout and you will be taken to that workout's own page. Here you can view all your exercises and its details by clicking on an exercise. You can view all sets and reps, edit them or delete them.

## Features to Implement

Some features I hope to implement in the future include a plate weight calculator, to quickly add common plates at the gym, and a graph for viewing your weight lifting progress over time.
